   - It can allow teams to demo or showcase new features in a controlled environment.
   - It provides a safe place to test and verify changes prior to being deployed to a live production environment.
   - A staging environment mimics the production environment which allows for more accurate testing to find any possible issues. 
   - It allows developers to add new features directly to production.
   ```
   Answer: It can allow teams to demo or showcase new features in a controlled environment, It provides a safe place to test and verify changes prior to being deployed to a live production environment, A staging environment mimics the production environment which allows for more accurate testing to find any possible issues
   Explanation: Staging can be used to demo new features and changes without impacting the production site
                Staging is its own environment and any changes made to it do not affect the production environment in any way. It is completely isolated
                Having the same setup as the production environment gives peace of mind that the changes being introduced are not going to cause issues when released to production
